#Real Time Clock
While working on my Chrome for Android Theme Color Viewer, still in progress, I wanted to add a working clock in the status bar of the phone and I got carried away and create this functionality with a nice background.

##Demo
[manuelvargas.me/time](manuelvargas.me/time)

{manuelvargas.me/time}(manuelvargas.me/time)

[manuelvargas.me/time]{manuelvargas.me/time)}
